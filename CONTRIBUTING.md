# How to Contribute to Grammes

## Getting Started

This project uses Go modules to manage dependencies, and is built on Go version `1.11`.

```sh
==> go get github.com/williamsia/grammes
```

## Testing

Grammes unit tests can be run by directing yourself to the root directory for the project and running this command in a terminal:

```sh
==> go test -parallel 3 --race ./...
```

## Imports Grouping

This projects adheres to the following pattern when grouping imports in Go files:

* imports from standard library
* imports from other projects
* imports from internal project

In addition, imports in each group must be sorted by length. For example:

```go
import (
  "time"
  "errors"

  "go.uber.org/zap"

  "github.com/williamsia/grammes/query/token"
  "github.com/williamsia/grammes"
)
```

## Making a Change

Before making any significant changes, please [open an issue](https://github.com/williamsia/grammes/issues). Discussing your proposed changes ahead of time will make the contribution process smooth for everyone.

Once we've discussed your changes and you've got your code ready, make sure that tests are passing (go test) and open your PR. Your pull request is most likely to be accepted if it:

* Includes tests for new functionality.
* Follows the guidelines in [Effective Go](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html) and the [Go team's common code review comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments).
